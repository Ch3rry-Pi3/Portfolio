# 🧑‍💻 **Basics of Programming Overview**

## 🧾 **Types of Programming Languages**

Programming languages differ in how code is executed and where it runs:

### 🖥️ **Interpreted Languages**  
- Source code is **read and executed line-by-line** by an **interpreter**.  
- Runs directly on your **operating system** or **web browser**.  
- Examples: **Python**, **JavaScript**, **Ruby**.

### ⚙️ **Compiled Languages**  
- Code is **converted into executable files** using a **compiler**.  
- Resulting programs run **natively on the device**.  
- Examples: **C**, **C++**, **Go**.



## 🏗 **Levels of Programming Languages**

Languages are grouped based on their level of abstraction from machine code:

- **High-Level Languages:**  
  - Easier to read/write.  
  - Include **query**, **structured**, and **object-oriented** languages.  
  - Examples: **SQL**, **Python**, **Java**, **C#**.

- **Low-Level Languages:**  
  - Closer to hardware instructions.  
  - Includes **assembly languages** used for **fine-grained control**.



## 🧠 **Planning and Organising Code**

### 📊 **Flowcharts**  
- Visual diagrams showing the **flow of logic** in a program.  
- Useful for outlining **decision points**, **loops**, and **process steps**.

### 📝 **Pseudocode**  
- Written explanation of code logic in **plain language**.  
- Helps translate ideas into code by describing **what each line should do**.



## 🆔 **Identifiers and Variables**

- **Identifiers** are **names** given to program components like **variables**, **constants**, and **functions**.  
- A **constant** holds a value that **does not change**, while a **variable** can **change during execution**.



## 🧩 **Functions**

- A **function** is a block of **reusable**, **stand-alone**, and **structured** code.  
- Performs **one specific task** and can be **called** multiple times from different parts of a program.



## 🧱 **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

- A methodology that focuses on **objects** (which bundle data and behaviours).  
- Objects are created from **classes**, which define their **attributes** and **methods**.  
- Promotes **encapsulation**, **reusability**, and **modularity**.



## 🚀 **Key Takeaways**

- Programming languages can be **interpreted or compiled**, with different execution models.  
- **High-level** and **low-level** languages suit different development needs.  
- **Flowcharts** and **pseudocode** help plan code before implementation.  
- **Identifiers** label program elements like **variables** and **constants**.  
- **Functions** are the building blocks of structured programming.  
- **Object-oriented programming** structures programs around **objects** rather than actions.
