## How It Works 🎯
The Pomodoro Timer follows a structured workflow:

4. **Repeat Steps 1-3 for 4 cycles.**
5. **Long Break (20 mins)** - After 4 work sessions, take a longer break.

✔ After each completed session, a **checkmark (✔)** appears.
✔ Press **Start** to begin the cycle and **Reset** to restart the timer.
