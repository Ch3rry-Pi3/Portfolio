# 🏦 **LeetCode 2990: Loan Types**  

## 📌 **Problem Overview**  
Given a dataset of **loan records**, we need to find all distinct **user IDs** that:  

✔ Have at least **one** loan of type `"Refinance"`.  
✔ Have at least **one** loan of type `"Mortgage"`.  

The output should be sorted in **ascending order** by `user_id`.  

## 🔍 **Example Walkthrough**  

### **Input:**
```python
loans_data = {
    "loan_id": [683, 218, 802, 593, 138, 193, 389],
    "user_id": [101, 101, 102, 102, 103, 103, 104],
    "loan_type": ["Mortgage", "AutoLoan", "InSchool", "Mortgage", "Refinance", "InSchool", "Mortgage"]
}
```

### **Processing Logic:**
| Loan ID | User ID | Loan Type  |
|---------|--------|------------|
| **683** | **101** | Mortgage   |
| **218** | **101** | AutoLoan   |
| **802** | **102** | InSchool   |
| **593** | **102** | Mortgage   |
| **138** | **103** | Refinance  |
| **193** | **103** | InSchool   |
| **389** | **104** | Mortgage   |

1. **Extract Users with Refinance Loans:**  
   - **Users**: `{103}`  

2. **Extract Users with Mortgage Loans:**  
   - **Users**: `{101, 102, 104}`  

3. **Find Intersection (Users with both Loan Types):**  
   - **Users who have both "Refinance" and "Mortgage" loans:**  
     `{102, 103}`  

4. **Sort in Ascending Order:**  
   - **Final Result:** `[102, 103]`

### **Expected Output:**
```plaintext
   user_id
0      102
1      103
```

## 🛠 **Python Solution**
```python
import pandas as pd

def loan_types(loans: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Finds distinct user IDs that have at least one 'Refinance' loan type 
    and at least one 'Mortgage' loan type.

    Parameters:
    loans (pd.DataFrame): A DataFrame containing loan information with columns:
                          - 'loan_id' (int): Unique identifier for each loan.
                          - 'user_id' (int): Unique identifier for each user.
                          - 'loan_type' (str): Type of loan ('Mortgage', 'Refinance', etc.).

    Returns:
    pd.DataFrame: A DataFrame containing:
                  - 'user_id' (int): Users who have both 'Refinance' and 'Mortgage' loans.
                  The result is sorted in ascending order by 'user_id'.
    """
    # Extract user IDs for each loan type
    refinance_users = set(loans.loc[loans["loan_type"] == "Refinance", "user_id"])
    mortgage_users = set(loans.loc[loans["loan_type"] == "Mortgage", "user_id"])

    # Find users who have both loan types
    eligible_users = sorted(refinance_users & mortgage_users)

    # Return as a DataFrame
    return pd.DataFrame({"user_id": eligible_users})
```

## ⏳ **Complexity Analysis**
| Step         | Operation                     | Time Complexity |
|-------------|------------------------------|----------------|
| Filtering   | `.loc[]` operation            | **O(N)** |
| Set Creation | `set(loans["user_id"])`       | **O(N)** |
| Intersection | `set & set` operation        | **O(M + K)** |
| Sorting     | `sorted()`                     | **O(M log M)** |
| **Total Complexity** | **O(N log N)** | ✅ Efficient |

Since sorting dominates the complexity, the overall complexity is **O(N log N)**.

## 🚀 **How to Use**
### **1️⃣ Installation**
Ensure you have **Python 3.x** and install Pandas if not installed:  
```bash
pip install pandas
```

### **2️⃣ Running the Script**
```bash
python loan_types.py
```

### **3️⃣ Sample Output**
```plaintext
   user_id
0      102
1      103
```

## 🎯 **Why This Approach?**
✔ Uses **Pandas filtering (`.loc[]`)** for efficient data selection.  
✔ Implements **set operations (`&`)** for quick lookups and intersections.  
✔ Ensures **sorted ordering by `user_id`** to match the problem requirements.  
✔ 🚀 **Optimised for large datasets with `O(N log N)` complexity.**  

🔥 **This method ensures a structured, efficient, and scalable solution for identifying users with both Mortgage and Refinance loans!** 🏦💰
