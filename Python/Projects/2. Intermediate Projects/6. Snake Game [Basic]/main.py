Snake Game üêç

A simple snake game using Python's `turtle` module. The snake moves around the screen,
and the player can control its direction using arrow keys.

Features:
- The snake starts as a three-segment entity.
- Smooth movement with `time.sleep()` for game pacing.
- Players can exit the game using the 'Escape' key.
