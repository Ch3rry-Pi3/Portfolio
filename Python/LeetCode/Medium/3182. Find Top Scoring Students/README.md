# 🎓 **LeetCode 3182: Find Top Scoring Students**  

## 📌 **Problem Overview**  

We have three tables:  

- **students**: Contains `student_id`, `name`, and `major`.  
- **courses**: Contains `course_id`, `name`, `credits`, and `major`.  
- **enrollments**: Contains `student_id`, `course_id`, `semester`, and `grade`.  

A student is considered a **top-scoring student** if they have:  
1. **Taken all courses in their major**.  
2. **Achieved a grade of 'A' in all these courses**.  

The result table should list the `student_id` of **top-scoring students**, ordered in **ascending order**.

### **Example 1**  
#### **Input:**
#### **students table:**
| student_id | name  | major             |
|------------|------|------------------|
| 1          | Alice | Computer Science |
| 2          | Bob   | Computer Science |
| 3          | Charlie | Mathematics  |
| 4          | David  | Mathematics  |

#### **courses table:**
| course_id | name              | credits | major             |
|-----------|------------------|---------|------------------|
| 101       | Algorithms        | 3       | Computer Science |
| 102       | Data Structures   | 3       | Computer Science |
| 103       | Calculus          | 4       | Mathematics      |
| 104       | Linear Algebra    | 4       | Mathematics      |

#### **enrollments table:**
| student_id | course_id | semester   | grade |
|------------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| 1          | 101       | Fall 2023  | A     |
| 1          | 102       | Fall 2023  | A     |
| 2          | 101       | Fall 2023  | A     |
| 2          | 102       | Fall 2023  | A     |
| 3          | 103       | Fall 2023  | A     |
| 3          | 104       | Fall 2023  | A     |
| 4          | 104       | Fall 2023  | B     |

#### **Output:**
| student_id |
|------------|
| 1          |
| 3          |

✅ **Explanation:**  
- **Alice (student_id 1)** took all **Computer Science** courses and got **A** in all.  
- **Bob (student_id 2)** did not take **all courses** in his major. ❌  
- **Charlie (student_id 3)** took all **Mathematics** courses and got **A** in all.  
- **David (student_id 4)** did not get an **A** in **Linear Algebra**, so he is not included. ❌  

## 🚀 **Approach & Intuition**  

### 🔹 **Key Idea:**
1. **Find all courses a student is supposed to take** using the **students** and **courses** tables.  
2. **Merge with enrollments** to check if a student took all required courses.  
3. **Filter students who got 'A' in every required course**.  

## 📝 **Implementation**  

```python
import pandas as pd

def find_top_scoring_students(enrollments: pd.DataFrame, students: pd.DataFrame, courses: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Finds students who have taken all courses in their major and earned an 'A' in all.
    
    :param enrollments: pd.DataFrame - Contains student_id, course_id, semester, grade.
    :param students: pd.DataFrame - Contains student_id, name, major.
    :param courses: pd.DataFrame - Contains course_id, name, credits, major.
    
    :return: pd.DataFrame - A list of student IDs who qualify as top-scoring students.
    """
    
    # Merge students with courses to determine the required courses for their major
    students_major = pd.merge(students, courses, how='inner', on='major')
    
    # Merge with enrollments to see which courses each student took and their grades
    students_grades = pd.merge(students_major, enrollments, how='left', on=['student_id', 'course_id'], indicator=True)
    
    # Find students who missed a course OR didn't get an A
    no_good_students = students_grades.query("_merge == 'left_only' or grade != 'A'")
    
    # Keep students who took all required courses and got all A's
    result = students_major[~students_major['student_id'].isin(no_good_students['student_id'])]
    
    return result[['student_id']].sort_values('student_id').drop_duplicates()
```

## ⏳ **Time Complexity Analysis**  

| Operation | Complexity |
|-----------|------------|
| **Merging tables** | **O(n)** |
| **Filtering students** | **O(n)** |
| **Sorting results** | **O(n log n)** |
| **Overall Complexity** | **O(n log n)** ✅ |

🔹 **Why is this optimal?**  
- **Merging is efficient** since we are only looking at relevant fields.  
- **Checking grades is linear** since each student has a limited number of courses.

## 🎯 **Key Takeaways**  
✔ **SQL-style merging helps relate students, courses, and enrollments**.  
✔ **Filtering and logical conditions identify top scorers efficiently**.  
✔ **Sorting ensures correct order of results**.  

🚀 **This is a common problem in educational and analytics applications!** 📊  

### ✅ **Corrections Made**
1. **Added `main()` function** to execute a test case.  
2. **Ensured the README title starts with "LeetCode 3182"**.  
3. **Removed references to images that were mistakenly included earlier**.
