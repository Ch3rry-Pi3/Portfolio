# 🧰 **Software Development Overview**  

## 🌐 **How Websites Work**  
Modern websites involve collaboration between **front-end** and **back-end** technologies:  
- **Web browsers** render content built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
- **Back-end servers** handle **data storage**, **business logic**, and **communication** with the front end.  
- Websites are **served** from back-end servers and **displayed** in the browser, often using APIs to exchange data.  



## 🖼 **Front-End Development**  
Front-end development focuses on creating the **user interface**:  
- Uses **HTML** (structure), **CSS** (styling), and **JavaScript** (interactivity).  
- Incorporates **libraries** (e.g. React, Vue) and **frameworks** (e.g. Angular) to create **reactive** and **responsive** experiences.  
- Aims to provide a seamless and engaging user experience across **devices** and **screen sizes**.  



## ⚙️ **Back-End Development**  
Back-end development supports the functionality of web applications:  
- Includes **business logic**, **security**, and **database access**.  
- Involves technologies like **Node.js**, **Python**, **Java**, **SQL/NoSQL databases**, and **server frameworks**.  
- Manages **user authentication**, **data storage**, **API services**, and **server-side rendering**.  



## 🤝 **Effective Teamwork**  
Collaboration plays a key role in software quality:  
- Leads to **fewer bugs**, **higher quality code**, and **better learning** among team members.  
- Helps reduce **stress** and promotes a **supportive development environment**.  

### 👥 **Pair Programming**  
A powerful team technique where two developers work together at one workstation:  
- One writes code (*driver*), the other reviews and guides (*observer*).  
- Promotes **knowledge sharing**, **code quality**, and **team efficiency**.  



## 🛠 **Developer Tools & Practices**  

### 🧾 **Version Control**  
- Tools like **Git** track **who made what changes** and when.  
- Enables **collaboration**, **rollback**, and **code merging**.  

### 🏗️ **Frameworks & Libraries**  
- Provide **reusable code** and standardised patterns for building applications.  
- Examples include **React**, **Spring Boot**, and **Django**.  

### 🔄 **CI/CD & Build Tools**  
- **Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment** automates testing and deployment.  
- **Build tools** (like Webpack, Gradle) and **package managers** (like npm, pip) streamline development workflows.  



## 🧱 **Software Stacks**  
A **software stack** is a combination of technologies used to build applications:  
- Front-end + back-end + database + tools.  
- Examples:  
  - **MEAN Stack:** MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js  
  - **LAMP Stack:** Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP  



## 🚀 **Key Takeaways:**  
- Websites are powered by **cooperation between front-end and back-end**.  
- **Responsive design** and **interactivity** are core to front-end success.  
- Back-end handles **data, logic, and security** behind the scenes.  
- **Teamwork**, especially techniques like **pair programming**, boosts software quality and developer growth.  
- Tools like **version control**, **CI/CD**, and **frameworks** standardise and improve development processes.  
- Understanding your **software stack** is essential for building robust applications.
