# 📝 **Software Engineering Fundamentals Overview**  

## 📌 **Overview**  
Software engineering is the **application of scientific principles** to the **design and creation of software**.  
A **software engineer's responsibilities** include designing, building, and maintaining **software systems**.  

### **Why Use the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)?**  
Using the **SDLC** can **improve efficiency** and **reduce risks** by:  
- Helping team members know **what to work on and when**.  
- Facilitating **communication** between the **customer, stakeholders, and development team**.  
- Allowing stakeholders to understand **their role** in the process.  
- Enabling **cross-domain teams** to know when to **move to the next phase**.

## 🔧 **Software Engineering Processes**  
Common processes include:  
- **Requirements Gathering:** Identifying stakeholders, setting goals, eliciting requirements, and documenting them.  
- **Design:** Structuring the software solution.  
- **Coding:** Writing and implementing software.  
- **Testing:** Verifying software functionality and performance.  
- **Releasing:** Deploying software for use.  
- **Documenting:** Recording the system design, code, and usage.  

### **Requirement Gathering Process:**  
1. **Identify stakeholders**  
2. **Establish goals and objectives**  
3. **Elicit requirements** from stakeholders  
4. **Document requirements**  
5. **Analyze, prioritize, and confirm requirements**

## 📑 **Key Documents:**  
- **SRS (Software Requirements Specification):** Details software functionalities and performance benchmarks.  
- **URS (User Requirements Specification):** A subset of SRS focusing on **user needs**.  
- **SysRS (System Requirements Specification):** Combines SRS details with **system capabilities, interfaces, user characteristics**, and **regulation requirements**.

## 🗺️ **Development Methodologies:**  
1. **Waterfall:** Linear and sequential approach.  
2. **V-Shape Model:** Verification and validation at each stage.  
3. **Agile:** Iterative and flexible, promotes continuous delivery and feedback.

## 🧪 **Types of Testing:**  
- **Functional Testing:** Ensures the system's **inputs and outputs** are correct.  
- **Non-Functional Testing:** Evaluates **performance, security, scalability, availability**.  
- **Regression Testing:** Confirms that recent changes do not negatively impact existing functionality.

## 📝 **Documentation Types:**  
1. **Requirements Documentation:** Captures user needs.  
2. **Design Documentation:** Describes the software architecture.  
3. **Technical Documentation:** Details code, APIs, and internal workings.  
4. **Quality Assurance Documentation:** Test plans and cases.  
5. **User Documentation:** Guides for using the software.
