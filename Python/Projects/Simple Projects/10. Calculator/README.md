# üßÆ **Calculator Application** ‚ú®

## Overview  
The **Calculator Application** is a simple Python program that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users can choose to continue calculations with the current result or start a new calculation. It's a fun and interactive way to practice Python programming while creating a practical tool! üéâ  

This project helps you:  
1. üß† Practice Python basics like functions, loops, and user input.  
2. üõ†Ô∏è Build a reusable and interactive application.  
3. ‚ú® Create something functional and fun to use!  

## How It Works  

1. **Choose an Operation**:  
   - Select one of the four basic arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.  

2. **Perform Calculations**:  
   - Enter the numbers to calculate the result.  

3. **Continue or Restart**:  
   - Choose to continue calculations with the current result or start fresh with new numbers.  

## How to Run  

1. Open a terminal or command prompt. üíª  
2. Navigate to the folder containing the files. üìÇ  
3. Run the program with the following command:  
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```

What is the first number?: 10
+
-
*
/
Pick an operation: *
What is the next number?: 5
10.0 * 5.0 = 50.0
Type 'y' to continue calculating with 50.0, or type 'n' to start a new calculation: y
```

### Continue Calculation:  
```plaintext

Pick an operation: +
What is the next number?: 25
50.0 + 25.0 = 75.0
Type 'y' to continue calculating with 75.0, or type 'n' to start a new calculation: n
```

### Start New Calculation:  
```plaintext
What is the first number?: 20
+
-
*
/
Pick an operation: /
What is the next number?: 4
20.0 / 4.0 = 5.0
Type 'y' to continue calculating with 5.0, or type 'n' to start a new calculation: n
```

## Key Features  

1. **üî¢ Basic Arithmetic**:  
   - Supports addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).  

2. **üîÑ Continuation Option**:  
   - Allows users to continue calculations with the current result.  

3. **üé® Interactive Interface**:  
   - Displays available operations and accepts user input for an intuitive experience.  

4. **‚ú® Modular Design**:  
   - Uses separate functions for each operation, making the code easy to read and maintain.  

## File Details  

### `calculator.py`  
The main program file that:  
- Handles user input for numbers and operations.  
- Performs calculations using functions stored in a dictionary.  
- Allows users to continue or restart calculations.  

### `art.py`  
Contains the ASCII art logo for the program, displayed at the start. üé®  

## Folder Structure  

Ensure the following files are in the same directory:  

```
calculator/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ calculator.py    # The main program logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ art.py           # Contains the ASCII art logo
```

## Additional Notes  

- üõ†Ô∏è Modify the `operations` dictionary in `calculator.py` to add more operations like exponentiation (`**`).  
- üéâ A great project to practice Python fundamentals and build a reusable tool!  

**üéâ Have fun calculating, and enjoy using your interactive calculator!** üßÆ‚ú®üî¢
