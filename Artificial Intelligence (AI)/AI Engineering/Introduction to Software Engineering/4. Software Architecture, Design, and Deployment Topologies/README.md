# üèõÔ∏è **Software Architecture, Design, and Deployment Topologies Summary**

## üß© **Software Architecture and Design**

### üèóÔ∏è **Software Architecture**  
- Functions as a **blueprint** for a system.  
- Emphasises the importance of **good architectural design** for building maintainable, scalable software.  

### üìö **Structured Design**  
- Breaks complex software problems into **well-organised, smaller solution elements**.  
- Facilitates easier development, testing, and maintenance.

### üé≠ **Behavioural Models**  
- Describe **what the system does** rather than **how** it performs the behaviour.  
- Focuses on **external behaviour** without detailing internal implementation.  



## üß© **Unified Modeling Language (UML) Diagrams**

Creating UML diagrams can **save time and money** by:  
- Helping developers **quickly understand** project structure.  
- Allowing **feature planning** before coding starts.  
- Making **navigation of source code** easier.

### ‚úèÔ∏è **Common Types of UML Diagrams:**  
- **State Transition Diagrams:** Show changes between system states.  
- **Interaction Diagrams:** Describe how components interact over time.  
- **Class Diagrams:** Illustrate classes, attributes, methods, and relationships.



## üß± **Objects and Classes**

- **Objects** contain **data** and **behaviours** (actions they can perform).  
- **Classes** are **blueprints** that define **attributes** and **behaviours** for objects.  
- Objects are **instances** of classes.



## üåê **Architectural Styles and Patterns**

### üîó **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**  
- Consists of **loosely coupled services** that communicate over a **network** via a **protocol** (e.g., HTTP, SOAP).  

### üñ•Ô∏è **Distributed Systems**  
- Run on **multiple machines/services** but **appear as a single coherent system** to the user.

### üèõ **Architectural Patterns**  
Reusable, repeatable solutions to common architectural problems:

| Pattern            | Description                                       |
|--||
| **2-Tier**          | Client communicates directly with server.         |
| **3-Tier**          | Separation between presentation, logic, and data. |
| **Event-Driven**    | Components react to events.                      |
| **Peer-to-Peer**    | All nodes are equal, sharing resources directly.  |
| **Microservices**   | Application is split into small, independent services. |

> üîî **Note:** Two or more patterns can sometimes be **combined**, but some may be **mutually exclusive**.



## üõ† **Application Environments**

Software moves through several environments before reaching users:

- **Development:**  
  - Where initial coding happens.  
- **Testing/QA:**  
  - Where quality assurance and bug fixes occur.  
- **Staging:**  
  - Final testing environment that mirrors production.  
- **Production:**  
  - **Live system** used by end-users.  
  - Must consider **load, security, reliability, and scalability**.



## ‚òÅÔ∏è **Deployment Options**

Applications can be deployed in different environments:

- **On-Premises:**  
  - Hosted on traditional, company-owned hardware.  
- **Cloud Platforms:**  
  - **Public Cloud:** Shared infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Azure).  
  - **Private Cloud:** Dedicated infrastructure for one organisation.  
  - **Hybrid Cloud:** Combination of public and private cloud resources.



## üñ•Ô∏è **Common Production Environment Components**

| Component           | Purpose                                             |
|-|--|
| **Firewall**         | Protects against unauthorised access.               |
| **Load Balancer**    | Distributes network traffic efficiently.            |
| **Web/Application Servers** | Host and run application logic.               |
| **Proxy Servers**    | Act as intermediaries between clients and servers.  |
| **Database Servers** | Store and manage data securely and reliably.        |



## üöÄ **Key Takeaways**

- **Architecture** serves as the foundational **blueprint** for any software system.  
- **Structured design** and **behavioural models** simplify planning and understanding.  
- **UML diagrams** provide clarity and reduce development time and costs.  
- **SOA and distributed systems** enhance modularity, scalability, and robustness.  
- **Architectural patterns** offer proven templates for solving design challenges.  
- Successful deployment requires careful planning across **multiple environments**, whether **on-premises** or **cloud-based**.  
- **Production environments** demand extra focus on **security, reliability, and performance**.
