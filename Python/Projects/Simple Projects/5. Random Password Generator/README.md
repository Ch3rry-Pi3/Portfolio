# 🔐 **PyPassword Generator** 🎉

## Overview  
The **PyPassword Generator** is a Python-based tool that creates secure passwords tailored to your preferences. Whether you need a quick, sequential password or a more randomized, secure one, this project has you covered!

This project helps you:
1. 🛡️ Generate strong, customizable passwords.  
2. 🎲 Practice Python skills like loops, lists, and the `random` module.  
3. ✨ Build a tool that’s both practical and fun!

## Setup Instructions  

### 1. Prerequisites  
- Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. 🐍  
  You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### 2. Run the Program  
1. Open a terminal or command prompt. 💻  
2. Navigate to the folder containing the script. 📂  
3. Run the program using the following command:  
   ```bash
   python pypassword_generator.py
   ```

### 3. Use the Generator  
- 📝 Enter the number of letters, symbols, and numbers you want in your password.  
- 🔐 The program will generate two types of passwords:
  - **Easy Password**: Sequential characters, without shuffling.  
  - **Hard Password**: Shuffled characters for better security.  

## Key Features  

1. **🔢 Customizable Composition**:  
   - Choose the exact number of letters, symbols, and numbers for your password.  

2. **🎮 Two Difficulty Levels**:  
   - **Easy Level**: Generates a password in sequential order.  
   - **Hard Level**: Randomly shuffles characters for added security.  

3. **🎲 Secure and Randomized**:  
   - Utilizes Python’s `random` module to ensure unpredictability.  

4. **🛠️ Beginner-Friendly**:  
   - Simple structure designed to help you practice Python fundamentals.  

## Example Usage  

### Input:  
```plaintext
How many letters would you like in your password?
5
How many symbols would you like?
2
How many numbers would you like?
3
```

### Output:  

**Easy Password**:  
```plaintext
abcdE!$123
```

**Password List (Before Shuffling)**:  
```plaintext
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'E', '!', '$', '1', '2', '3']
```

**Password List (After Shuffling)**:  
```plaintext
['2', '!', 'b', 'c', '$', 'E', '1', 'a', '3', 'd']
```

**Your Password**:  
```plaintext
2!bc$E1a3d
```

## Additional Notes  

- 🛡️ Use the hard-level password for maximum security.  
- 🔧 Customize the script by adding more symbols or altering character pools.  
- 🐣 A great project for beginners to practice Python while building something useful!  

**🔐 Stay secure and happy coding!** 🎉
