    "\n",
    "Single candlestick patterns provide insights into market sentiment. Examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Doji**: Signals market indecision, where opening and closing prices are nearly equal.\n",
    "- **Hammer and Hanging Man**:  \n",
    "  - **Hammer**: Indicates a bullish reversal after a downtrend.  \n",
    "  - **Hanging Man**: Suggests a bearish reversal after an uptrend.\n",
    "- **Shooting Star and Inverted Hammer**:  \n",
    "  - **Shooting Star**: Suggests a bearish reversal after an uptrend.  \n",

    "\n",
    "These involve combinations of two or more candlesticks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Engulfing Patterns**:  \n",
    "  - **Bullish**: A small bearish candlestick followed by a larger bullish candlestick.  \n",
    "  - **Bearish**: A small bullish candlestick followed by a larger bearish candlestick.\n",
    "- **Morning Star and Evening Star**:  \n",
    "  - **Morning Star**: A three-candlestick pattern signaling a bullish reversal during a downtrend.  \n",
    "  - **Evening Star**: A three-candlestick pattern indicating a bearish reversal during an uptrend.\n",
