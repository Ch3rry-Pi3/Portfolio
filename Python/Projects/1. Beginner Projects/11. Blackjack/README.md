# üÉè **Blackjack Game** ‚ô£Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è

## Overview  
The **Blackjack Game** is a Python implementation of the classic card game. In this game, you compete against the computer to get a hand value as close to **21** as possible without exceeding it. The program handles the card dealing, score calculation, and game logic, creating a fun and interactive experience! üéâ  

This project helps you:  
1. üß† Practice Python programming with loops, conditionals, and functions.  
2. üÉè Build a dynamic card game with simple yet engaging logic.  
3. ‚ú® Enhance problem-solving skills while creating a fun project.  

## How It Works  

1. **The Goal**:  
   - Get as close to **21** as possible without going over.  
   - A score of exactly **21** with the first two cards is a **Blackjack**.  

2. **Game Rules**:  
   - Cards are worth their face value, face cards are worth **10**, and Aces are worth **1** or **11**, depending on the hand value.  
   - The computer must draw cards until its total is at least **17**.  

3. **Win/Lose Conditions**:  
   - If your total exceeds **21**, you lose.  
   - If the computer‚Äôs total exceeds **21**, you win.  
   - The highest total under **21** wins.  

## How to Run  

1. Open a terminal or command prompt. üíª  
2. Navigate to the folder containing the files. üìÇ  
3. Run the program with the following command:  
   ```bash
   python blackjack.py
   ```

### User's Turn:  
```plaintext
Your cards: [10, 7], current score: 17
Computer's first card: 6
Type 'y' to get another card, type 'n' to pass: n
```

### Computer's Turn and Final Results:  
```plaintext
Your final hand: [10, 7], final score: 17
Computer's final hand: [6, 9, 5], final score: 20
You lose üò§

## Key Features  

1. **‚ô†Ô∏è Card Dealing**:  
   - Randomly deals cards from a simulated deck.  

2. **üìä Score Calculation**:  
   - Calculates scores dynamically, including handling Aces as **1** or **11**.  

3. **üéÆ Game Logic**:  
   - User can draw cards or pass.  
   - Computer follows rules to draw cards until it reaches a total of at least **17**.  

4. **‚ú® Interactive Gameplay**:  
   - Provides real-time updates on card hands and scores.  
   - Displays results with fun emojis and messages!  

## File Details  

### `blackjack.py`
