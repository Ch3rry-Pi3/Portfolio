  The following are differential equations involving the unknown function $ y $:  
  
  \[
  \frac{dy}{dx} = 5x + 3 \tag{1.1} \quad 📈
  \]
  
  \[
  e^{x} \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + 2 \left( \frac{dy}{dx} \right)^2 = 1 \tag{1.2} \quad 🔢
  \]
  
  \[
  4 \frac{d^3y}{dx^3} + (\sin x) \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + 5xy = 0 \tag{1.3} \quad 🔄
  \]
  
  \[
  \left( \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} \right)^3 + 3y \left( \frac{dy}{dx} \right)^2 + y^3 \left( \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} \right)^2 = 5x \tag{1.4} \quad 🧮
  \]
  
  \[
  \frac{\partial^2y}{\partial t^2} - 4 \frac{\partial^2y}{\partial x^2} = 0 \tag{1.5} \quad 🌍
  \]

### 🤔 Fun Fact

A *differential equation* is an **ordinary differential equation** (ODE) if the unknown function depends on only one independent variable. 🧭 If the unknown function depends on two or more independent variables, the differential equation is a **partial differential equation** (PDE). 🌌  

With the exceptions of *Chapters 31 and 34*, the primary focus of this book will be on ordinary differential equations. 🎯
