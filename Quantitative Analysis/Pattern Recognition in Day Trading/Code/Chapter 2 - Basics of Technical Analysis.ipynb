    "Technical analysis focuses on using historical market data, primarily **price** and **volume**, to forecast price movements and make trading decisions. It is a key tool for identifying potential trading opportunities and managing risk. This chapter explores the fundamentals of technical analysis, its tools, and concepts.\n",

    "## <span style=\"color:#4682B4\">**2. Understanding Technical Indicators**</span> <a id=\"understanding-indicators\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Technical indicators are mathematical tools derived from price and volume data that provide insights into market trends, volatility, and price behavior. They are used to identify patterns, confirm trends, and generate buy or sell signals. Technical indicators can be broadly categorised into three types:\n",
    "1. **Trend-Following**  \n",
    "2. **Momentum**  \n",
    "3. **Volatility**  \n",
    "\n",
    "These indicators play a critical role in decision-making for traders by simplifying complex market movements.\n",

    "### <span style=\"color:#4682B4\">**2.1. Trend-Following Indicators**</span> <a id=\"trend-indicators\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Trend-following indicators identify the dominant direction of a market trend, capturing its momentum, and generating signals for entry or exit points. Common trend-following indicators include:\n",
    "- **Moving Averages (MA):** Smooths price fluctuations to identify overall trend direction. Calculated using:\n",

    "  SMA_t = \\frac{\\sum_{i=t-n+1}^t P_i}{n}\n",

    "  - $ P_i $: Price at time $ i $  \n",
    "  - $ n $: Number of periods in the moving average  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exponential Moving Average (EMA):** Assigns more weight to recent data, making it more responsive to recent price changes. Its formula:\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  EMA_t = \\alpha \\cdot P_t + (1 - \\alpha) \\cdot EMA_{t-1}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",

    "  - $ EMA_t $: Exponential Moving Average at time $ t $  \n",
    "  - $ P_t $: Price at time $ t $  \n",
    "  - $ EMA_{t-1} $: EMA at the previous time step  \n",

    "- **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** Oscillating between 0 and 100, it helps to identify *overbought* and *oversold* levels:\n",
    "  \n",

    "  RSI = 100 - \\left( \\frac{100}{1 + RS} \\right)\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Bollinger Bands:** Consist of a set of three lines plotted on a price chart. The middle line is a simple moving average, while the upper and lower bands are calculated by adding or subtracting a specified number of standard deviations from the moving average.

    "\n",
    "Chart patterns are visual representations of price movements that repeatedly occur in financial markets. These patterns are formed by combinations of price and time, providing valuable insights into future price movements.\n",

    "### <span style=\"color:#4682B4\">**3.2. Types of Chart Patterns**</span> <a id=\"chart-patterns-types\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Head and Shoulders:** A pattern with three peaks, where the middle peak (head) is higher than the two side peaks (shoulders). It signals a potential trend reversal from bullish to bearish.  \n",
    "- **Double Top/Bottom:** Indicates reversals; a double top suggests a bearish reversal, while a double bottom signals a bullish reversal.  \n",
    "- **Triangle Patterns:** Formed as prices converge into a triangular shape, signaling potential continuation in the breakout direction. Types include ascending, descending, and symmetrical triangles.  \n",
    "- **Flag and Pennant:** Short-term continuation patterns occurring after strong price moves. Flags are rectangular, while pennants are triangular, both suggesting the trend will continue.  \n",
